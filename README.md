Hi, I’m @terschure 

I’m interested in many things, including biology, creative coding, data visualisation and illustration. You can find some my creative projects on my website: https://anneketerschure.nl/

I have a PhD in archaeogenomics for which I used OBITools and R to process and analyse DNA metabarcoding data, hence the dataprocessing repositories here.
